This directory contains source code that simulates various aspects of
a target. It is mainly thought to assist in testing and debugging the rest of
UrJTAG. The connection between UrJTAG and the code here currently is by means
of a special "cable" named "jim", which can access a virtual chain of devices.
The only device yet is "some_cpu", which is automatically put in the chain when
you type "cable jim".
